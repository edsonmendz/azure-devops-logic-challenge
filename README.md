# Azure DevOps Technical Challenge - Snack Bar Data Flow 🍔

This project was developed as part of a technical selection process for a Frontend position at **Azure DevOps**. The core objective was to build a robust data filtering engine to handle snack bar orders with varying and complex data formats.

## 🚀 The Technical Challenge
The main goal was to ensure **Data Integrity**. The application receives order data in multiple formats, and I had to develop a logic that:
- Validates the structure of each incoming order.
- Filters out inconsistent or wrongly formatted data.
- Ensures only "clean" data proceeds to the next stage of the application.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Quality Assurance
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Testing Suite:** **Jest / Jasmine** (Logic validated via `test.js`).
- **Success Rate:** **100% Pass** on all provided test batteries.

## 💡 Why this is important
Passing a technical challenge from a high-level company like Azure DevOps proves my ability to:
1. **Follow Strict Requirements:** Coding exactly what was requested.
2. **Write Testable Code:** Logic structured in a way that can be automatically validated.
3. **Problem Solving:** Handling "dirty data" is one of the most common and critical tasks in professional software development.

*Note: Although I didn't join the team at that time, this project remains a testament to my technical proficiency and commitment to code quality, achieving full success in all logic tests.*
